### Decentralised

> What does this mean? To what extent?

Looking at it from the traditional client-server architecture lens, bottom up.

- Infrastructure? âœ…

High number of nodes participating on the Ethereum mainnet, which host the system logic.

- Transaction processing? âœ…

Transaction logic is processed at the blockchain level, meaning multiple p2p clients execute the code and come to consensus.

- User interface? ðŸ†—

While Uniswap's official UI is hosted by a US company, anyone can run this frontend locally. The dApp code is OSS which makes it even easier. it has also been deployed to IPFS - only requires connection to a node.

### Beyond Decentralised

#### Permissionless

- Who is allowed to participate? âœ…

Any Ethereum account can perform swaps or provide liquidity

1. Background (Univ1 - Uni v3, some about AMMs)

## Background

Uniswap v1 - 2018. can only pair ERC20-ETH. No token-to-token "directly". Can still be done in the same tx, but had to route through an ETH pair.

Uni V3 defines [Range Orders](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/concepts/V3-overview/range-orders#buy-limit-orders), but in fact, it is still not a CLOB. [Its creators tout it](https://twitter.com/danrobinson/status/1504867385009852419?s=20&t=Gm0NAAlzU5Yt9huMjuSgcQ) as a hybrid between AMM and CLOB. 2. Actors 3. Pricing

"liquidity pool share" [source](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper.pdf)

## Questions that may arise?

How does Uniswapâ€™s pricing mechanism work ?
Who provides liquidity to the system ?
Why would someone provide liquidity to the system ?
How does the system represents the liquidity ?

Can you provide liquidity with only 1 side of the pair?
